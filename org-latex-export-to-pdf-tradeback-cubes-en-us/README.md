# Description
This is an Export Template for the [Org Novelist](https://github.com/sympodius/org-novelist/) writing system called, 'Cubes.'

It outputs a PDF suitable for US Tradeback books.

It requires the following typefaces unless changed by the user:

- Libre Baskerville
- Josefin Sans
- DejaVu Sans Mono
- Alegreya SC

Some settings can be easily changed through the variables under 'User Variables' in the org-latex-export-to-pdf-tradeback-cubes-en-us.el file. More advanced changes will require deeper editing of that file.

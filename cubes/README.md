# Org Novelist Export Templates :: Cubes

</div>


# Introduction
These are the flagship export templates for the [Org Novelist](https://github.com/sympodius/org-novelist/) writing system. Please consult the main Org Novelist `README.md` for general instructions on how to use Org Novelist export templates with your novels.

We should have screenshots of the output, and a list of all the customisation variables, as well as any programs or fonts needed to operate the export templates

It outputs a PDF suitable for US Tradeback books.

It requires the following typefaces unless changed by the user:

- Libre Baskerville
- Josefin Sans
- DejaVu Sans Mono
- Alegreya SC

Some settings can be easily changed through the variables under 'User Variables' in the org-latex-export-to-pdf-tradeback-cubes-en-us.el file. More advanced changes will require deeper editing of that file.
